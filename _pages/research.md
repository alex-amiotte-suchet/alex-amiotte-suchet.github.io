Entre économie politique institutionnaliste, économie des PME et de l'innovation et histoire économique, ma recherche porte sur les institutions du financement public des PME et de l'innovation. Elle se concentre autour de 3 principaux axes :
1. Le changement institutionnel dans l'histoire des dispositifs publics pour le financement des entreprises.
2. Le pouvoir de valorisation des financements publics et la légitimité des organisations et des acteurs qui les portent.
3. Les effets des financements publics sur les trajectoires des entreprises.

Vous trouverez sur cette page un résumé de mes travaux en cours, individuels et collectifs.

Somewhere between institutionalist political economy, small business and innovation economics and economic history, my research focuses on the institutions involved in the public financing of SMEs and innovation. It focuses on 3 main areas:
1. Institutional change in the history of public arrangements for corporate financing.
2. The valuation power of public funding and the legitimacy of the organisations and actors behind it.
3. The effects of public funding on company trajectories.

On this page you will find a summary of my work in progress, both individual and collective, as well as my previously published work.

## Working papers

* _Are eco-responsible businesses sustainable?_ - with Marion Michel.

In a context where the health crisis has particularly affected French businesses, this article looks at a specific sector, that of eco-responsible consumer goods entrepreneurship. We examine the functioning of a moralized market space, comparing it to conventional businesses and studying its internal structure. Using a mixed method combining semi-directive interviews, online ethnography and company accounting data, we highlight the polarisation of the eco-responsible sector between SMEs that generate profits similar to those of conventional companies and very small, highly precarious one-person companies. In this way, we qualify the results on the economic difficulties of companies in moralised markets. We explain this polarisation by the link between the mobilisation of public funding mechanisms and the implementation of marketing and advertising strategies by highly qualified entrepreneurs in the commerce and communication sector.

* _The power of public funding: how far do the ‘certification effects’ extend?_

This paper presents the literature on the certification effect, which quantifies the positive signal that a company sends to private investors when obtaining public funding. After presenting the emergence of this literature and its main results, it sets out to establish a dialogue between this public policy evaluation literature and an institutionalist political economy theoretical framework. Taking into account the importance of public intermediaries' both symbolic capital and valuation power, it proposes a broader understanding of the certification effect.

* _Financing businesses: an affair of State?  Rise and financialisation of public financing for small and medium-sized enterprises in France_

Contemporary economic policies have become increasingly reliant on lending and guarantee instruments managed by public banks. Does this trend signal a return of the state, or rather the financialisation of public action? This article explores the long-term institutional transformations of public SME financing in France, analysing the evolving roles of finance, businesses, and the state. Drawing on historical institutionalism and the political economy of financialisation, it examines both the creation and the gradual financialisation of the institutional arrangement governing public SME financing. Based on extensive sources — 108 archive boxes, additional historical materials, and ten semi-structured interviews — the study traces the emergence of a financialised institutional arrangement that has underpinned French economic policy since the late 1990s. Initially centred on public guarantees developed in the interwar period, the introduction of public loans in the 1980s produced a fragile arrangement that ultimately facilitated financialisation through the integration of financial devices and actors. This historical trajectory helps explain the recent conjunction of renewed public intervention and the consolidation of financialisation dynamics.
