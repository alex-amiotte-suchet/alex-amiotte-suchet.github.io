Entre économie politique institutionnaliste, économie des PME et de l'innovation et histoire économique, ma recherche porte sur les institutions du financement public des PME et de l'innovation. Elle se concentre autour de 3 principaux axes :
1. Le changement institutionnel dans l'histoire des dispositifs publics pour le financement des entreprises.
2. Le pouvoir de valorisation des financements publics et la légitimité des organisations et des acteurs qui les portent.
3. Les effets des financements publics sur les trajectoires des entreprises.

Vous trouverez sur cette page un résumé de mes travaux en cours, individuels et collectifs.

Somewhere between institutionalist political economy, small business and innovation economics and economic history, my research focuses on the institutions involved in the public financing of SMEs and innovation. It focuses on 3 main areas:
1. Institutional change in the history of public arrangements for corporate financing.
2. The valuation power of public funding and the legitimacy of the organisations and actors behind it.
3. The effects of public funding on company trajectories.

On this page you will find a summary of my work in progress, both individual and collective, as well as my previously published work.

## Working papers

* _Are eco-responsible businesses sustainable?_ - with Marion Michel.

In a context where the health crisis has particularly affected French businesses, this article looks at a specific sector, that of eco-responsible consumer goods entrepreneurship. We examine the functioning of a moralized market space, comparing it to conventional businesses and studying its internal structure. Using a mixed method combining semi-directive interviews, online ethnography and company accounting data, we highlight the polarisation of the eco-responsible sector between SMEs that generate profits similar to those of conventional companies and very small, highly precarious one-person companies. In this way, we qualify the results on the economic difficulties of companies in moralised markets. We explain this polarisation by the link between the mobilisation of public funding mechanisms and the implementation of marketing and advertising strategies by highly qualified entrepreneurs in the commerce and communication sector.

* _The power of public funding: how far do the ‘certification effects’ extend?_

This paper presents the literature on the certification effect, which quantifies the positive signal that a company sends to private investors when obtaining public funding. After presenting the emergence of this literature and its main results, it sets out to establish a dialogue between this public policy evaluation literature and an institutionalist political economy theoretical framework. Taking into account the importance of public intermediaries' both symbolic capital and valuation power, it proposes a broader understanding of the certification effect.

* _From corporate to financial guarantees. A form of indirect public intervention at the origins of the planning state_

This paper examines the genesis and subsequent transformations of an important form of contemporaneous public intervention: guarantees. Drawing on the archives of French public organisations, it shows that it was with the development of the planning state that this instrument institutionalised, even though it reflected a vision of public action based on private initiative. Much studied today, this instrument is therefore not new, even if its financialised form which appeared in the 1980s came later.
